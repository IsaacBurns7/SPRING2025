surprising stuff: well, it was weird to me that we could do generic iterators, and use typenames to apply general algorithims
- in a discrete math sense, it's like treating all containers as "sets"
- "in A, for all x,", where A and x can be any container of any typenames
- this is very cool.

- ifstreams & ofstreams can iterate through a file until a sentinel(its a 1 liner).
- this is very cool.

- beyond that this was mostly known territory
