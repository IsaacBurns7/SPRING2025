[1] When first reading this chapter, keep a record of information that was new or surprising to
you. Later, use that list to focus your further studies.
- in notes.txt
[2] (∗1) List five standard-library containers.
- vector, deque, map, string, list(doubly linked!)
[3] (∗1) List five standard-library algorithms.
- sort, find, copy, merge, count, replace
[4] (∗1) List five standard-library headers.
- vector, map, string, iostream, fstream
[5] (∗1.5) Write a program that reads a name (a string) and an age (an int) from the standard
input stream cin. Then output a message including the name and age to the standard output
stream cout.
- in 5/main.cpp
[6] (∗1.5) Redo §X.5[5], storing several (name,age) pairs in a class. Doing the reading and writing using your own >> and << operators.
- in 5/main.cpp
[7] (∗2) Initialize a vector<int> with the elements 5, 9, −1, 200, and 0. Print it. Sort is, and print it
again.
- in 7/main.cpp
[8] (∗1) Repeat §X.5[7] with a vector<string> initialized with "Kant", "Plato", "Aristotle",
"Kierkegard", and "Hume".
- in 7/main.cpp
[9] (∗1) Open a file for writing (as an ofstream) and write a few hundred integers to it.
[10] (∗1) Open the file of integers from §X.5[9] for reading (as an ifstream) and read it.
